To start the project, we have to:

1. Extract the env file.

2. Extract the node_modules file.

3. Run the command: npm start.

Note: If you run the command "npm start" an error will occur.

So you have to run the command "npm install --force" to install the dependencies.

However, if you can't run the npm command, it means that you have to install

node.js
